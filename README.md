CA Brief Introduction...) 
Forming in 1977, Dire Straits consisted primarily of David Knopfler (rhythm guitarist), Pick Withers (Drums), John Illsley (Bass) and Mark Knopfler (lead guitarist). Arguably their most famous hit 'Sultans of Swing' was then released on 9 June 1978 on the first album 'Dire Straits'. As well as being the first album the band had compiled together, it reached #5 on UK charts proving it was popular amongst the british public. (MAYBE INSERT QUOTE HERE ABOUT THE BAND)

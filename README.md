# Luke's Curation and Analytics Portfolio feat. Dire Straits 
## WEEK 1

*A Brief Introduction...*

Forming in 1977, Dire Straits consisted primarily of David Knopfler (rhythm guitarist), Pick Withers (Drums), John Illsley (Bass) and Mark Knopfler (lead guitarist). Arguably their most famous hit 'Sultans of Swing' was then released on 9 June 1978 on the first album 'Dire Straits'. As well as being the first album the band had compiled together, it reached #5 on UK charts proving it was popular amongst the british public. (MAYBE INSERT QUOTE HERE ABOUT THE BAND)

*Current music data available and the existing challenges that are present*

When looking into the data that is available for Sultans of Swing, it remains clear that there is a wide variety of descriptive, notated, and acoustic data across many social platforms. Taking the example of the social media platform Youtube, there is a considerable amount of descriptive data with regards to the following: 
* Band members involved with the recording 
* Song lyrics 
* Identification of album and year released 
* Writer(s) 
* Artist(s) 

I decided to investigate whether  all of the factors recorded above are included in the other mainstream music platforms - Spotify and Apple Music. The descriptive data results are recorded below.

# Luke's Curation and Analytics Portfolio feat. Dire Straits 
## WEEK 1

*A BRIEF INTRODUCTION...*

Forming in 1977, Dire Straits consisted primarily of David Knopfler (rhythm guitarist), Pick Withers (Drums), John Illsley (Bass) and Mark Knopfler (lead guitarist). Arguably their most famous hit 'Sultans of Swing' was then released on 9 June 1978 on the first album 'Dire Straits'. As well as being the first album the band had compiled together, it reached #5 on UK charts proving it was popular amongst the british public. (MAYBE INSERT QUOTE HERE ABOUT THE BAND)

*CURRENT MUSIC DATA AVAILABLE AND THE EXISTING CHALLENGES THAT ARE PRESENT*

When looking into the data that is available for Sultans of Swing, it remains clear that there is a wide variety of descriptive, notated, and acoustic data across many social platforms. Taking the example of the social media platform Youtube, there is a considerable amount of descriptive data with regards to the following: 
* Band members involved with the recording 
* Song lyrics 
* Identification of album and year released 
* Writer(s) 
* Artist(s) 

I decided to investigate whether  all of the factors recorded above are included in the other mainstream music platforms - Spotify and Apple Music. The descriptive data results are recorded below. Apple data corresponds to the first line and Spotify to the second.  (Yes = Y   No= N)

There is also a wide range of notated data for the song existing online which includes various transcripts. As well as this, there is also a compilation book which contains a big majority of Dire Straits' hits available at: [musicroom.com](https://www.musicroom.com/dire-straits-sultans-of-swing-very-best-of-piano-musdg70826)


Acoustic data is furthermore a big presence on the web. Youtube is a very good source for this with evidence of numerous live performances of the song, and additionally, individuals doing 'cover versions' too. Arguably one of the best live performances ever done can be seen on Youtube here: [Sultans of Swing Alchemy Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pa9x9fZBtY)

## WEEK 2

*SULTANS OF SWING IN NOTATION*

This week, the task was to identify a piece of music which we could download and edit in Musescore. I downloaded part of a Sultans of Swing score into PDF format which was then converted into Musescore and 10 bars were edited. I also kept an additional score which was again converted into Musescore but no changes were made to this one and remained unedited. This allowed me to see the differences in the specific notational data clearly between both the edited and unedited scores, and it made for an interesting observation to see what elements had been omitted from Musescore when the PDF was converted into the programme. (INSERT ORIGINAL PDF, UNEDITED SCORE - PDF? EDITED SCORE EITHER PDF OR MUSESCORE)


## WEEK 3 

This week's task was primarily based on converting a MusicXML file of our chosen piece into the encoding standard known as MEI (Music Encoding Initiative). The score can be viewed with the link provided below here shown through the lense of Verovio:
